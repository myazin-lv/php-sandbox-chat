Backend
- authorization
- api:
  - uri - /graphql
  - entities:
    - User(id: int, login: string, password: string)
    - Message(id: int, sender: User, recipient: User, messageBody: text, createdAt: datatime)
  - operations:
    - start chatting with recipient using link
    - start chatting with recipient using login
    - get list of available chats for User
    - get list of last 10 messages between User and recipient
  - queries:
    - chats(sender: User)
    - message(last: 10)
  - mutations:
    - send message to recipient
- database - MySQL

Frontend
- JS + React + Material UI
- websocket connection to backend
  - new message event handle (senderId, senderLogin, messageBody, createdAt)

Scenarios:
If: User opens index page of site
Then: Backend tries to identify User

    If: User was not identified
    Then: Backend renders Authentication Form

    If: User was identified
    Then: Backend renders Main Page template:
        - Header
        - Status bar: Logged as <User>, Logout button
        - Section consists of 2 columns:
            - Left Column:
                - input control for new chat login name
                - list of chats (old recipients)
            - Right Column consists of 2 rows:
                - messages from selected chat
                - input control for new message + send message button

    If: Authenticated User on Main Page click on Logout button
    Then: Session ends

    If: Authenticated User on Main Page activate input for new login name
    Then: Right Column displays empty message list

    If: Authenticated User on Main Page activate item in list of chats (recipients)
    Then: Right Column displays last 10 messages from chat with selected recipient

    If: Authenticated User on Main Page enter new message text and push the send message button
    Then: Message is sent to the recipient:
      - Frontend send mutation data to Backend graphql-api
      - Backend writes new message to the database,
      - Backend send event through websocket to sender and recipient Frontends (if connection is established),

    If: Frontend of Authenticated User on Main Page receives new message event from webwsocket connection
        and message sender is Authenticated User and message recipient is Current Chat
    Then: Frontend displays message from event
